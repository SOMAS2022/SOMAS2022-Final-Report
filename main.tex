\begin{abstract}
The economic climate of the world today has demonstrated our reliance on sparse resources. However, given society's increasing use of automation, there may be methods to combat this issue of sparsity by helping people and artificial systems work together to distribute these resources in a just manner. Notably, informed decision-making through social interaction and collective risk analysis increases the chance of satisficing most individuals. To demonstrate the viability of this hypothesis, a project was designed that simplified the issues of today into a cooperative survival game. Agents programmed with different strategies must act as a collective to defeat monsters level by level. At each level, these agents must communicate and decide on the distribution of sparse resources that can aid them in their tasks, and this decision is aided by the election of a chair to help formalize the views of the collective. Ultimately, while the game was not won by most agent teams, the utilization of communication and an elected chair aided agents in progressing further in the game than when performing random actions. Given this result, we believe that an improvement in the communication systems in the game would yield even greater progress in the game.
