\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Each teams results show that the addition of social interactions between agents and informed collective decision making improve agent performance when compared to a population of agents acting purely randomly. However, it is also clear that a more comprahensive and wide ranging set of possible messages between agents would have greatly aided their decision making processes and allowed team to see the full influence of their ideologies. In conjunction with this, improved mathematics algorthims would make the game easier to analyse and play by spreading deaths over many levels, instead of mass deaths and quick end-games. 

Therefore this project concludes that the introduction of a norm-goverened society, where agents interact on a social level to determine collective actions and allocate sparse resources, allowed the players to advance further in the game. Possible future developements would envolve integrating all team agents into a single environement and see if the combination of different non-random agents improves performance. This would hinge upon a new agent communication langauge, expanding the messages agents can send to fully utilise their strategies.  

% teams could do better than random
% more communication subjects would further increase prgoresses
% better math algos w.r.t stamina potions would make the game easier and winnable

% future work... integrate the agents and develop a new agent comms language and see if the combination of no random agents improves the performance of the game
